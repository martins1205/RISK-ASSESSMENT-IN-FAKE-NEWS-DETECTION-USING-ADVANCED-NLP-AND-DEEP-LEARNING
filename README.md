## Overview
This project implements state-of-the-art deep learning models for detecting fake news. It leverages advanced architectures like BERT , MiniLM , LSTM , and BLSTM to classify news articles as either authentic or misleading. The system is designed for both researchers and end-users, offering a seamless experience through a Streamlit-based web interface.

## Key features include:

Real-time news article analysis
Advanced text preprocessing and feature extraction
Detailed credibility metrics and risk assessment
Support for English language
The best-performing model, BERT , achieves 99.97% accuracy , making it a reliable tool for combating misinformation.

# Features
Real-Time Analysis : Analyze news articles instantly with confidence scores.
Advanced Text Preprocessing : Clean and normalize input text using NLP techniques.
Deep Learning Models : Choose from multiple architectures (BERT, MiniLM, LSTM, BLSTM).
Detailed Metrics : View probability breakdowns, content credibility features, and improvement suggestions.
User-Friendly Interface : Built with Streamlit for an intuitive and interactive experience.
Risk Assessment : Evaluate false positive rates (FPR), false negative rates (FNR), and overall error rates (OER).
# Dataset
The project uses two datasets:

Fake.csv: Contains fake news articles.
True.csv: Contains legitimate news articles.
These datasets are preprocessed to ensure high-quality training and evaluation.
